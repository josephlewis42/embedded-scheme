# Embedded Scheme

[r5rs]: https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/

Embedded Scheme is a Scheme implementation for languages that can run on the JVM. 
It can optionally be used in stand alone mode which just runs the interpreter.

The goal of Scheme is to build a small, well documented, and compliant version of Scheme.

* **Small** means it should be understandable in about half an hour to a newcomer.
* **Well documented** means it should have thorough tests, Java docstrings, and be readable. 
* **Compliant** means it implements the 
  [R5RS standard][r5rs] and (optionally) 
  [common SRFIs](https://srfi.schemers.org/) when they don't conflict with the other goals.
